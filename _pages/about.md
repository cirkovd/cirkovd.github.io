I am a final year Statistics PhD candidate at Texas A&M University advised by <a href="https://tw398.github.io/twang/" target="_blank">Dr. Tiandong Wang</a>, <a href="https://people.tamu.edu/~dcline/" target="_blank">Dr. Daren Cline</a> and <a href="https://zhangxiany-tamu.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Xianyang Zhang</a>. My research interests include random networks and extreme value theory. In particular, I am interested in the scale-free behavior of degree distributions, as well as temporal dynamics in random networks. 

Before coming to Texas A&M, I completed a M.S. in Statistics and a B.S. in Mathematics & Statistics at Miami University. My master's thesis, advised by <a href="https://miamioh.edu/profiles/cas/thomas-fisher.html" target="_blank">Dr. Thomas Fisher</a>, worked on a problem in time series analysis.
